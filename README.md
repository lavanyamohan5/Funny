# Interactive Button Web Project 

This project started from an idea I came across online and found interesting.  
Instead of just watching it, I decided to **understand how it works**, **rebuild it**, and **learn from it**.

After learning the logic, I customized the project and added my own understanding, structure, and explanations.  
This repository is shared **purely for learning and practice purposes**.

## Why I built this

While learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I realized that small ideas can become interactive with very little code.

This project helped me understand:
- How JavaScript reacts to user actions
- How buttons and elements can be controlled dynamically
- How timing and animations improve user experience

Most importantly, it made learning **fun**.

## What this project does

- Displays a simple question with two buttons
- The **No** button playfully avoids interaction
- The **Yes** button triggers:
  - a heart loading animation
  - a short delay
  - a result screen with a video

The goal is not the content, but the **interaction and logic behind it**.

## Technologies Used

- HTML – page structure  
- CSS – styling, positioning, and animations  
- JavaScript – interaction and DOM manipulation  

No external libraries or frameworks are used.

## What I learned

- Selecting and controlling HTML elements using JavaScript
- Handling events like `click` and `mouseover`
- Using `display` and positioning to control screens
- Creating animations using pure CSS
- Improving user experience using simple logic

## Learning note

This project is **not an original concept**, but a **learning-based implementation**.

I believe learning by:
> observing → understanding → modifying → sharing  

is one of the best ways to grow as a developer.

If this helps another beginner feel confident, that itself is a win
